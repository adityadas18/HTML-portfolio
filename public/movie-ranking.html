<h3>GODFATHER TRILIGY</h3>
<p>This triligy has 3 movies but my favorate one woulb the 2nd one as it shows the true or the beginning of the Don corlione HOW he became the way he is now!</p>
<h3>THE NOTEBOOK</h3>
<p>This movie was so beautiful and I could relate withthe protaginist on soo many levels that I cant discribe in words but i'll try to.
    He did so much for the girl he loved just like me was a true romatic and didn't know when to stoploving someone!</p>
<h3>YEH JAVANI HAI DEWANI</h3>
<p>This movie has so many childhood memories Ican't begin to tell you this was the best this I watched as a child.It had love, fun, mountains, friends, glipses of adulting, very good songs and it has a very setifying ending. </p>
